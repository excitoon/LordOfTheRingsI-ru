LAST MINUTE CORRECTIONS	to "THE LORD OF THE RINGS, Volume One"
Version 1.0

1. ADDITIONAL CREDITS
   ("The Lord of the Rings, Volume 1" was created thanks to the efforts of
many talented individuals. The following people were not credited in the
manual and deserve credit here):
	
	SCOTT LA ROCCA, Sound FX
	PAUL BANNING, Additional Playtest

2. SKILLS (Additional)
   In "The Lord	of the Rings, Volume One", characters have a maximum
of ten skills each. Being taught a skill a second time does not
improve the character's ability in that skill; it just wastes the
skill slot.

3. MULTIPLE SAVED GAMES
   "The Lord of the Rings, Volume One" allows a player to save a 
maximum of two games. However, a new game will rewrite BOTH saved
games; if you believe you will want a new game, press OPTION and save
game #2 at the very start of play.

4. SAVED GAMES FROM DISKETTE
   If you are playing "The Lord of the Rings, Volume One" from 5 1/4"
floppies, you will need an additional formatted diskette. This is the
data disk; when saving and loading a new game, you will be prompted
to insert this disk at the appropriate time. This disk is not
provided with this game; you will have to provide and format a data
disk yourself.

5. SCROLLING THROUGH THE CARTOON
    The reference card for "The Lord of the Rings, Volume One" is 
incorrect. The right mouse button will not advance the cartoon, but
the space bar and the <ENTER> key will.
